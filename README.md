## Student Operation

### Students will **fork** the class repository
On most days, the lab folder will have some starter-code for them to copy. They will generally be making a new repository each day and copying that code in as a starting point.

It's advisable that the students first make an new org (perhaps called '401-js-<their-name>') that these repositories can be created in, to help them organize things better.

### ASSIGNMENTS

  * **READING (Due before each lecture)**
    * Reading assignments should be done as articles/notes in the **wiki** of their repo fork
    

  * **LAB Assignments (4 per block)**
    * 10 Points (graded on the rubric)
    * ~ 3-5 Hours
    * Should be completed in a new repository for each day
    * Generally, these are smaller implementations, refactors, and practice to support the lecture concept. Not necessarily a full-scale application.
    * Code must be tested through Travis and deployed through either Heroku or AWS
    * JS Code must be documented with JSDoc
    * APIs must also be documented with Swagger
    * Students must use the README.md template (from the resources folder) to complete their assignment
    * The README requires working links to deployed code, Travis, functional documentation, test documentation and a UML and/or data-flow diagram.

  * **DESIGN (1 per block)**
    * 10 Points (complete/incomplete)
    * Timebox to ~1-2 Hours
    * Following a short lecture at the end of each block, students will iteratively build out a scalable "design" or "theme" which should be easily transferable to any project they do.
    
  * **DS&A IMPLEMENTATION**
    * 10 Points (complete/incomplete)
    * Installed at the root level of your `data-structures-and-algorithms` repository
    * These will be used as libraries to solve code challenges
    
  * **DS&A CODE CHALLENGE (4 per block)**
    * 5 points (3 points for whiteboard, 1 point for testing, 1 point for working code)
    * Generally requires a working implementation (above) to work
    * Timebox execution to ~ 1 Hour
        
    
  * **END OF BLOCK PROJECT**
    * 25 Points (graded on the rubric)
    * ~ 2 Days (10 hours)
    * Generally Paired
    * Takes the learnings/components/modules from the previous 4 classes and has the students assemble them into a larger/full-scale application.

# Solution: Data Modeling With NoSQL Databases

Note that students will likely not get to the modular version of this assignment. Getting the first assignment completed with a full set of tests is a large bucket of work.

Treat Assignment 1 as 70% of the grade. Instructors will code review Assignment 2 and students can re-submit that for the remaining grade.

## Lab Requirements

### Grading Standards & Notes
  * Features
    * Full CRUD
  * Code Quality
    * It's highly important that the students get things wired right. There's not a lot of code today in terms of functionality/logic, but the wiring is critical. If they get it, they got it...
  * Testing
    * 100% Coverage on all of the CRUD Methods
    * Modular version should have a test that loops through the different implementations and can easily test them all.
  * Deployment
    * Travis Only
  * Documentation
    * README Standards
    * JSDoc Required

#### Lab Assistance Notes
* Push them towards creating a class to do the work, and a function that then calls the class with some code block (see create-code.js)

# My First(ish?) Tested Node Application

Setup:

* make sure you're on master
* `git checkout -b node-exercise-2`

[Example](https://github.com/alchemycodelab/fsjs-be-demos/tree/master/01_review/01_node/exercise-2)

In create-dog.js create a function `createDog` that takes name, age, and weight.
Return a dog object with name, age, weight. Export your `createDog` function
with `module.exports`. **TEST** your function first.

Run your tests with `npm run test:watch`

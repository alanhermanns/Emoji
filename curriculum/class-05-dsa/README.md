# Facilitators Guide: Data Structures and Algorithms

Today the students have 2 major assignments. First is this DS&A Implementation, followed by the regular lab.

Encourage the students to work on the DS&A Implementation at home/after hours and the lab itself while on campus, with instructional team assistance available.

## Overview

At the end of each block, in accordance with the 401 Common Curriculum guidelines, students are presented with a new data structure and/or computer science concept.

Refer to [common curriculum guide](https://github.com/codefellows/common_curriculum/tree/master/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-05) for CLASS-05

## Data Structure Implementation

The assignment associated with this class will be to implement the data structure for the upcoming block.

Implementations should be done as a fully tested, require-able library. They will be the foundation on which all code challenges in the next block depend on, in order to run.

  * 10 Points
  * Full Implementation (features in the assignment)
